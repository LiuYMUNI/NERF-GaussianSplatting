# Representation Learning: NeRF and Gaussian Splatting

This repository contains Yumao Liu's personal learning notes and practical explorations of two state-of-the-art scene representation learning techniques:
- **Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)**
- **Gaussian Splatting (GS)**

The goal is to develop a deep, hands-on understanding of both the mathematics and implementation details behind modern neural scene representation and rendering.

## Contents

- [`nerf_from_nothing/`](./nerf_from_nothing/):  
  My self-written notebook and explanatory materials on NeRF, including core theory, code, visualizations, and step-by-step explanations of key mechanisms such as ray sampling, volume rendering, positional encoding, and hierarchical sampling.

- [`gaussian_splatting/`](./gaussian_splatting/):  
  My structured English notes summarizing the core ideas and algorithmic steps behind Gaussian Splatting, including initialization from SfM points, 3D Gaussian formulation, image-space projection, differentiable rasterization, loss computation, and adaptive density control.

## Why this project?

- Demonstrates hands-on understanding of leading neural representation learning methods, not just from papers but also through working code and visualization.
- Serves as a reference for others interested in mastering modern 3D scene modeling pipelines.
- Complements my research experience in SLAM, 3D vision, and perception for robotics.
